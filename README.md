### Project Structure (Simplified):

```
/client         # React frontend
  /src
    /components 
      StockAnalysisLayout.jsx  # Main UI component with chart, tabs, etc.
      StockSearch.jsx        # (Legacy component, may be removed/repurposed)
    App.jsx
    index.css
    main.jsx
  vite.config.js
  package.json

/server         # Node.js backend
  /api
    stock.js           # API endpoints for stock quote and historical data (Yahoo Finance)
    trendSummary.js    # (Currently separate, might use Alpha Vantage or be refactored)
    symbolSearch.js    # (Placeholder/legacy for symbol search, might use Alpha Vantage)
  index.js           # Main server file
  package.json

.env            # Environment variables (e.g., API keys - not for Yahoo Finance public data)
README.md
```

### Setup and Running:

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Backend Setup:**
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    # Create a .env file if needed for OTHER API keys (e.g., OpenAI for future "Ask AI" features).
    # Yahoo Finance (via yahoo-finance2) does not require an API key for public data.
    # Example .env for potential future use:
    # OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_KEY
    npm start 
    ``` 
    The backend server (for stock data) will typically run on `http://localhost:5001` (as configured in `StockAnalysisLayout.jsx` API calls).

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend development server will typically run on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port shown in the terminal).

4.  **Access the application** in your browser at the frontend URL.

### Key API Endpoints:

- `GET /api/stock?symbol=:symbol`: Fetches current quote data for the given stock symbol from Yahoo Finance.
- `GET /api/stock/historical/:symbol`: Fetches historical daily data (last 1 year) for the given symbol from Yahoo Finance.
- `GET /api/trend-summary?symbol=:symbol`: Fetches various data points from Yahoo Finance and generates a textual trend summary.
- `GET /api/symbol-search?query=:query`: Searches for stock symbols on Yahoo Finance based on the query.

*(Note: Ensure API keys are handled securely and not hardcoded directly in the source if you are using services that require them, like OpenAI for future AI features.)*
